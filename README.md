#Eyes Project

#Project description:
The eyes project was assigned and developed to further teach the fundamentals of manipulating styles. Using the skills learned thus far in my journey to become a full stack developer, this project shows what happens when you bring together JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic experience. 
The eyes generated on your screen are programmed to follow user mouse movement around the screen. 

#How to Run:
To run this project on your machine the first thing you need is to clone all the files in this repository to your machine. Drag and drop the index.html file onto your browser window. Watch the eyes follow every movement of your mouse. 


#Roadap to Future Improvements:
In the future an improvement I plan on making is adding irises around each pupil and then adding a button that allows a user to change the iris color.
